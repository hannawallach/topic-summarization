The European Economic Community recommended that its 12 member governments authorize individuals to make their own electricity and buy up all excess energy from private sources. The EEC's executive Commission said Thursday that private production of electricity is being discouraged or even banned throughout the trading bloc by legislation that presents ``insurmountable obstacles to self-generation'' of electricity by users. The Commission, in a formal recommendation, said the member governments should allow self-production and obligate utility companies to buy surplus energy at fair prices. Such a system, it said, would help stimulate the development of alternative sources of energy and lead to better use of available resources.
